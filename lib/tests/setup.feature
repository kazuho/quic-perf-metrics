     when the setup script is run
     then it succeeds
     and a branch is created called "gh-pages" containing "index.html"
     and a branch is created called "gh-issues" containing "issues.json"
     and gitignore lists the xml file

  Scenario:  Run setup script on directory with no draft
    Given an empty git repo
      and lib is cloned in
      when the setup script is run

    Given a git repo with multiple Kramdown drafts
     when the setup script is run
     then it succeeds

  Scenario:  Run setup script on directory with no origin remote
    Given a git repo with no origin
     and lib is cloned in
     and a Kramdown draft is created
     when the setup script is run
     then it fails
     and generates a message "remote"

  Scenario:  Run setup script on directory without pushing to master
    Given a git repo with no origin
     and an empty origin remote is added
